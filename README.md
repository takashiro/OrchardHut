Introduction
----------

The Orchard Hut project tries to implement a light-weight online shop
written in PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript, without any PHP frameworks.
The archetecture resembles that of Discuz! 7 (or lower version).
Although many frameworks are powerful, I think what PHP offers is
enough to implement a simple online shop.
